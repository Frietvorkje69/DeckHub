## How To Use?
DeckHub is supposed to be used in the Gaming Mode of the Steam Deck, it can be added to the Steam Library as a non-steam app. The following video shows how to do that. I also included all the necessary images for poster, capsule, hero, etc. in the <a href="https://github.com/Frietvorkje69/DeckHub/tree/master/img" target="_blank">src/img</a> folder.
